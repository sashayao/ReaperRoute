# Reaper Route

This is the proof of concept of a solution to the problem of congestion in the city of vancouver. The solution is called Reaper Route and it tells us the statistics for likelyhood of dying and/or getting into an accident for a specified route.

The site is hosted on a heroku server and needs to be run on "localhost:5000" if you cannot get the heroku server to start please try typing the command '''npm install express''' as this is likely the package that you are missing once this is done you should be relocated to the homepage. If not please type in "localhost:5000/home" in your search bar.
